# Overview:
The purpose of this project is to gather Citibike sharing data for the month of August and analyze the results to determine if we could create a similar bike sharing business in Des Moines, IA.  

# Results:
Please see Tableau story in link above.

# Summary:

By looking at the data, we can come to the conclusion that male subscribers are the highest volume users, checking out bikes between 7-9am and 5-6pm, suggesting that they use these bikes for commuting to and from work.  This could work well for the city of Des Moine as the potential bikesharing business could target these customers for recurring revenue.  There would be less tourist, or one-time use customers as Des Moines is not know as a tourist destination.

It would be nice to create a visualization regarding where the tourist customers have come from in order to target advertising in these areas, and as well as pull the similar data from the subscribers to see if subscribers from other cities use their subscription while they are on vacation.
